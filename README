Sight is the syntax highlighter chrome extension for those cases when the content of a source code file is displayed inline (on the browser) instead of downloaded.
Based on SHJS lib.

It is actually not on the Google Chrome Extensions Gallery because I can't pay the developer fee at the moment.

Just double click the sight.crx to install.

After installing just access any github raw url to try it out.
Example: http://github.com/tsenart/PlumaCMS/raw/master/app/controllers/pluma/articles_controller.rb
