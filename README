Sight is the syntax highlighter chrome extension for those cases when the content of a source code file is displayed inline (on the browser) instead of downloaded.
You can choose the theme on the options page
Based on SHJS lib.

Here are some screenshots:

It is actually not on the Google Chrome Extensions Gallery because I can't pay the developer fee at the moment. 

Just double click the sight.crx to install.

After installing just access any github raw url to try it out.
