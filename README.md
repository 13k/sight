What is it?
===========
*Sight* is the Syntax Highlighter Chrome extension that makes reading code on the browser a joy.

You can now [install it](http://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/epmaefhielclhlnmjofcdapbeepkmggh) on the Google Chrome Gallery.

After installing just access any Github raw url to [try it out](http://github.com/tsenart/sight/raw/master/js/background.js).
