What is it?
===========
*Sight* is the syntax highlighter chrome extension for those cases when the content of a source code file is displayed inline (on the browser) instead of downloaded.
You can choose the theme on the options page.
Based on SHJS lib.

I want it! But how?
===================
You can either use the packed version *sight.crx* or use the unpacked version if you want.

    $ git clone git://github.com/tsenart/sight.git

Now just open the sight directory with your file manager and double click *sight.crx*.
If you don't the extension .crx associated with Google Chrome just open it with these arguments from the terminal:

    --load-extension=sight/

The extension is actually not on the Google Chrome Extensions Gallery because I can't pay the developer fee at the moment. 

After installing just access any github raw url to try it out.
