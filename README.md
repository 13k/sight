What is it?
===========
*Sight* is the syntax highlighter chrome extension for those cases when the content of a source code file is displayed inline (on the browser) instead of downloaded.
You can choose the theme on the options page.
Based on SHJS lib.

I want it! But how?
===================
You can now [install it](http://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/epmaefhielclhlnmjofcdapbeepkmggh) on the Google Chrome Gallery.

After installing just access any github raw url to [try it out](http://github.com/tsenart/sight/raw/master/js/inject.js).
